<u> <h1> The Flat Earth Theory</h1></u>

  <p>Flat Earth is a theory that we are on a flat plane rather than a sphere. Also, the idea that Antarctica is an ice barrier that surrounds all of the continents.

    <h1>Why Would Antarctica be the barrier of the Earth?</h1>

    <div>
    -In 1959, the Antarctic Treaty  was signed by twelve of the most powerful countries to make Antarctica as a sciEntific preserve
    </div>
    <div>
    -With this treaty in place, people cannot explore the continent without getting removed or heavily watched
    </div>
    <div>
    -All flight patterns take you away from Antarctica
    </div>
    <div>
    -Earth’s only continent without a native human population

  <h2>NASA plays a part</h2>

  <p>NASA controls everything we know about the world. Everything we learn about space, the Earth, the Moon, the Sun etc. comes from NASA. All the images that NASA provides are made from the combination of multiple images merged together. In some pictures the same cloud formations appear which is shown below.

  <h1>  Proof of Flat Earth</h1>

  <p>During a flight from the Philippines to California, a woman’s water broke. The plane had to make an emergency landing, instead of continuing the trip to California the pilot made an emergency landing to Alaska.
