  <h3><center><u> The trip to the moon:</h3></center></u>
       <p>Most of the information we know about space exploration is given to us by  <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr>. It stands for National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA is an independent agency of the executive branch of the federal government of the United States. It is responsible for space research, so everything we know comes from them, however, do we know if that information is accurate? Could the government be lying to us in order to protect its image?</br></p></br>

<p>
    Conspiracy theorists claim that N.A.S.A staged the moon landing in order for America to win the space race. Since the mid-1970s, many people believe that NASA and other organizations "knowingly misled the public into believing the landings happened, by manufacturing, tampering with, or destroying evidence including photos, telemetry tapes, radio and TV transmissions, Moon rock samples, and even killing some key witnesses." (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing_conspiracy_theories#The_Space_Race" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
People have conducted surveys in which they asked others their opinions over the moon landing and whether or not they believe is fake or not. The results were gathered from multiple different places, and the results are shown below!</br>
</br>
<u><strong>Percentages of people who believe the landing was fake (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing_conspiracy_theories#The_Space_Race" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>): </strong></br></u>
<!--start poll percentages in bullet points-->
  - Americans: Between 6% and 20%  </br>
  - Britons: 25% </br>
  - Russians: 28%</br>



<h5>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<u>What evidence do conspiracy theorists have to say that the landing could be a hoax?</h5></u>

  <p>It's clear that technology had improved tremendously over the years compared to 1969. It's only logical that travelling to the moon would mean we had sophisticated technology,however, technology wasn't as advacned as we know today so it would've been difficult. Aside from the technology, people claim that during the live broadcast the American flag "fluttered"(<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2018/07/20/why-do-people-believe-the-moon-landing-hoax-or-other-conspiracy-theories/?utm_term=.5cac3659c266">Washington post</a>) as if it was moved by the wind. However, there is NO wind in space. So why would the flag be moving in the first place? The idea is that excaclty, that the landidng was FAKE. The reason for which the United states wouoldlie about actually going to the moon is because they wanted other nations to see how advanced they are and for the soviet union(at the time) to stop it's space exploration and admit defeat.  </p>
