<center><h2><u>The history behind the space Race:</h2></u></center>
  <p>The space race was a comptetiton between the Soviet union <em>(which is known as Russia today)</em> and the United States who were rivals during the cold war. The soviet Union favored and spread communism while the United states favored democracy which gave voice to its citizens. Both tried to achieve great advancements in space exploration and set higher ideals of their nation. Therefore, the space race began and resulted in America having the first man on the  moon. However, is the evidence valid? Did we really go to the moon or was it made up as a way to defeat and prevents the Soviet Union's exploration?</p>

       <p>Most of the information we know about space exploration is given to us by  <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr>. It stands for National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA is an independent agency of the executive branch of the federal government of the United States. It is responsible for space reasearch and has various programs.</br></p></br>
